Because the second band appears exactly were the most interesting bands of the mosquitoes are, we are going to use the first band to detect the spectra contaminated by the water vapor and remove it from our data. In order to do that we check how smooth are the spectra between 3900 and 3500 cm<sup>-1</sup>, fitting that region to a polynomial. Only the spectra without noise will fit well."
